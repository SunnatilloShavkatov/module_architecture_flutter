# Antigravity Template-Cloning Workspace

Welcome to the ultra-optimized workspace.

1. **Golden Rule**: We DO NOT invent architecture. We **CLONE** it.
2. **References**: The gold standard for this project is **`docs/TEMPLATE_REFERENCE.md`**. Always use this as the reference feature for the AI to read and replicate unless another specific module is provided.
3. **Execution**: Use `.agent/workflows/clean_arch_feature.workflow.md` prompt template. The AI will read the reference and write exactly identical code structure for the new feature.
4. **Delivery**: Return only production-ready code. No talk, no explanations.
